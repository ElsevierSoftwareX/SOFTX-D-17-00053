This directory must contain the needed attenuation data for the elements/componds
used in the beamhardening set up. These include the X-ray target (e.g. W.txt), the filter
materials (e.g. Al.txt, Cu.txt), the specimen material and the detector material (e.g. CsI.txt).
Values have been obtained from the xcom program and the appropriate data column extracted
to simplify reading. Data resolution of 0.5KeV steps is assumed through out (using the values
in grid.txt). Currently A maximum energy of 150KeV is assumed though this can be increased.
