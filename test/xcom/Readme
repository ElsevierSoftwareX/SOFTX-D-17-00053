This directory must contain the needed attenuation data for the elements/componds
used in the beamhardening set up. These include the X-ray target (e.g. W.txt), the filter
materials (e.g. Al.txt, Cu.txt), the specimen material and the detector material (e.g. CsI.txt).
Values have been obtained from the xcom program and the appropriate data column extracted
to simplify reading. Data resolution of 0.5KeV steps is assumed through out (using the values
in grid.txt). Currently A maximum energy of 250KeV is assumed though this can be increased.

The fortran program xcom is available from:
   http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Xcom/Text/download.html
There is a web based interface to generate attenuation data, though it seems to only deal
with ~116 values at a time which means that several runs would be needed to generate all
the data points and the the files merged afterwards.
Hence it may be easier to compile and run the Fortran code XCOM.f to generate new data, if
a Fortran compiler is to hand; this is usually the case on Linux systems but may be more
awkward on Windows unless a cygwin or MinGW install is present.

The XCOM program has a very rigid input format and any error causes it to exit.
The input needed to generate data for copper is:

copper
2
Cu
2
3
2
grid.txt
Cu_out.txt
1


where a file grid.txt exists with the energy points required and the output
will be placed in the file Cu_out.txt.
As well as single elements it is possible to specify mixtures composed of known
element weight fractions.

The output format generated by XCOM is not simple to read and has several values
other than the attenuation withcoherent scatter which is used by the beam hardening
software.

On Linux systems an awk can be used to extract the required data:

awk -f script.awk < Cu_out.txt > Cu.txt

where the file "script.awk" should contain:

NF==8  && /E[+-]/ {if ($7=="+Infinity") $7=1e9; if ($1 < 1e-6) $1=0.0; printf "%8.5f %10.5f\n",1000.*$1,$7+0.0}

The attenuation file should then be moved into the directory "test/xcom". It is then possible to use the new
as a filter, calibration sample or material to correct for. The material name to use is the
same as the file name, e.g "Cu" (with the .txt) for copper in the above case.
